# WIP: Ask The Page
Chrome extension to ask questions about the current page using OpenAI GPT-3 API.
It contains two parts: a Chrome extension and a backend server (written in Python).
Backend server is used to store indexed pages and not saving any user data like questions and api keys.

![How it looks now](https://github.com/Hormold/ask-the-page/blob/master/docs/demo.jpeg?raw=true)
## Installation
